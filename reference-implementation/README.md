# ERC-6900 Ref Implementation

Reference implementation for [ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900). It is an early draft implementation.

The implementation includes an upgradable modular account with two plugins (`SingleOwnerPlugin` and `TokenReceiverPlugin`). It is compliant with ERC-6900 with the latest updates.

## Important Callouts

- **Not audited and should NOT be used in production**.
- Not optimized in both deployments and execution. Weâ€™ve explicitly removed some optimizations for reader comprehension.

## Development

Anyone is welcome to submit feedback and/or PRs to improve code or add Plugins.
